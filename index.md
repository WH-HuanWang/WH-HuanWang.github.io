## &nbsp; <b>Biography</b>
* * *
> I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University. I obtained my undergraduate degree and master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2016 and 2021, respectively. I used to have deep research in medical information processing, especially medical image analysis and electrocardiogram diagnosis. Now I focus on efficient and robust artificial intelligence for complex electromechanical system intelligent diagnosis. I have a strong interest and deep research foundation in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of rotating machinery, high-speed trains, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles, and lithium-ion batteries. I am good at using efficient and credible artificial intelligence algorithms to solve and meet real industrial problems and needs. At present, I have published more than 30 academic papers, including more than 20 SCI journal papers. I have obtained a number of invention patents. In addition, I won the Best Applied Paper Award at the Quality and Reliability Annual Conference of Tsinghua University, Outstanding Paper Award of China Industrial Engineering Doctoral Forum and the Outstanding Graduate of Sichuan Province.
